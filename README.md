# 🚀 30 Days of DSA Challenge  

Welcome to my **30 Days of DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** Challenge!  
This repository documents my **daily journey** of learning, practicing, and mastering core DSA concepts using **Java** and **C++** to enhance my **problem-solving skills** and prepare for **technical interviews** at top tech companies like **Google**, **Microsoft**, and others.  

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Challenge  

Over the next 30 days, I aim to:  
- 🔹 Strengthen my understanding of **fundamental and advanced data structures**.  
- 🔹 Learn different **algorithmic approaches** (Brute Force → Optimized).  
- 🔹 Improve **problem-solving speed and accuracy** through consistent practice.  
- 🔹 Build the habit of **daily coding and structured thinking**.  
- 🔹 Lay a strong foundation for **competitive programming** and **interview prep**.

## 🧠 Learning Strategy  

Each day includes:  
1️⃣ **Concept Learning** → Understanding theory from trusted resources (GeeksForGeeks, LeetCode, YouTube, etc.)  
2️⃣ **Problem Solving** → Solving at least one problem on LeetCode or similar platforms  
3️⃣ **Notes & Reflections** → Writing short summaries of what I learned and my approach  
4️⃣ **Code Uploads** → Pushing clean, well-documented code to this repository daily
